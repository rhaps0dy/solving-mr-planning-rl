Code used in making the undergraduate thesis "Solving Montezuma's Revenge with
Planning and Reinforcement Learning".

- `examine_game`: scripts for examining the memory and testing the options.
- `planning`: the implementation of IW(3) on position, based on [Lipovetzky,
	Ramirez and Geffner's](https://github.com/miquelramirez/ALE-Atari-Width).
- `learning`: the implementation of Sarsa for the learning results.
- `Arcade-Learning-Environment`: slightly modified ALE, notably with added
	rewards to MR and some methods and attributes made public.
